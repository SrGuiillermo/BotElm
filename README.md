If used for the first time add your configuration to the bot by creating a new file "config.py" and paste this:

```
config = {
    "tmi" : "",
    "channels" : [""],
    "authorized" : [""],
    "propietary" : [""],
}
```

Where:

- **tmi** is the oauth token used for the bot (can be generated here: https://twitchapps.com/tmi/)
- **channels** is the channels where the bot will connect
- **authorized** is the twitch account names with acces to the minor commands
- **propietary** is the twitch account name of the propietary of the bot with acces to the mayor commands
